## What Constitute an Ideal Open Task RFP?

The structure of this programâ€™s Open-Task will include both bounty-style Open Task RFP and open-style Open Task RFP.

For **bounty-style Open Task RFP**, we will list out specific ideas that we are seeking individuals to work on. Here are some examples of this type of Open Task RFP:

- Create a Halo2 tutorial.
- Snark mobile proving kit.

    Make a Halo2 aggregation toolbox: a simple tool to let ppl merge proofs, prove them, and make a verifier.

For **open-style Open Task RFP**, we will list out relatively open questions that we are seeking individuals to explore further with. Here are some examples of this type of Open Task RFP:

- Differential privacy projects.

    Study differential privacy for zkstarts , mpc stats and zkpipes ideas. Can we design a VM that leakes 0 info but allows meaningful communications?

- Folding Scheme.

    Study folding schemes and research potential use cases.

For the initial iterations of this program, **we will start with the more specific bounty-style first**, as it allows us to develop the program in a more calculated manner.
