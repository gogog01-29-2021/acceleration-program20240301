# Open Task RFP List

If you're a PSE research team member, please submit your ideas by creating an issue and follow the provided template.

## [Mobile GPU Prover](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/10)

Enable msm to work on a mobile GPU.

## [RSA GitHub Wallets POC](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/11)

Enable transfers using git commits and pull requests. Continuously update the state of the repo via integration.

## [Quantum Computer Canary and Safe Exit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/12)

Implement transfers using git commits and pull requests. Ensure continuous updating of the repo's state via integration.

## [PLONK by hand, Nova by hand](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/9)

Provide an implementation/tutorial for individuals to self-construct Plonk, Nova, and related topics.

## [Mobile SNARK Proving Kit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/8)

Develop a mobile-friendly tool akin to websnark, harnessing GPU and TPU for rapid proof generation.

## [A SNARK to prove X prime numbers exist below Y](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/7)

This project may resemble the creation of a proof of unsat.

## [Halo2 Aggregation Toolbox](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/6)

Create a user-friendly halo2 aggregation toolbox, enabling users to merge proofs, verify them, and produce verifiers.

## [Halo2 Soundness Bug Examples](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/5)

Establish a repository featuring small halo2 circuits, each presenting a unique soundness bug.
